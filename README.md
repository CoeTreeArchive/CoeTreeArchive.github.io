# The Coe College Tree Archive

The Coe College Tree Archive is an online record of trees on the west side of Coe's campus. By creating an online archive, the project attempts to collect valuable environmental data, promote engagement with Coe's urban forest, and ultimately shape how the Coe community views its trees. The online archive features interactive maps, profiles of Coe's trees, environmental benefit estimates, tips for tree identification at Coe, and opportunities to contribute to the archive.

Detailed replication instructions for the project are forthcoming. The project structure is currently undergoing revisions as we try to make it easier to add new trees to the project and allow for multiple years of tree data to be published at once.
