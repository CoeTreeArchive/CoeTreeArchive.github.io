# The Coe College Tree Archive

*Project Description*: The Coe College Tree Archive is an online record of trees on the Coe College campus. By creating an online archive, the project attempts to collect valuable environmental data, promote engagement with Coe's urban forest, and ultimately shape how the Coe community views its trees. The online archive features interactive maps, profiles of Coe's trees, environmental benefit estimates, tips for tree identification at Coe, and opportunities to contribute to the archive.

This document presents a detailed description of the project execution. This includes guidance on how to collect data for the project, how to replicate the analysis, how to recreate the website, and how to best access the data collected from the project. Specifically, this document covers:

## Overview of Methodology

At a high-level, there are just three steps required to add to the Coe College Tree Archive:

1.  Data Collection
2.  Data Preparation
3.  Data Analysis
4.  Website Update

This document will take a look at each of these steps in the project's construction in greater detail later, so for now, consider the following brief summaries of each step.

### Data Collection

Adding to the archive begins with collecting data on trees. The data collection process involves recording information pertaining to the location, size, and species of each tree in a certain area. To make this process clear and easy to integrate with the rest of the archive, you should collect data using the [Data Collection Sheet](https://github.com/CoeTreeArchive/CoeTreeArchive.github.io/raw/main/documentation/data-collection-sheet.xlsx) template. If you are interested in adding data to the Coe College Tree Archive, all you need to do is complete this sheet and send it to [coe.tree.archive\@gmail.com](mailto:coe.tree.archive@gmail.com). (Note: it is also highly recommended that you also send photographs of the trees separately.) Although how you complete the sheet is up to you, collecting data will require a soft tape measure,
