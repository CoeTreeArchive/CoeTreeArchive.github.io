    "text": "Guiding Principles\n\nTrees are a Part of Our College Identity\nTrees—particularly Oak trees—have long been an important part of the identity of Coe College. The College’s yearbook, which ran from 1903 through 2007, was called The Acorn. Likewise, the College’s sesquicentennial logo features an acorn and Oak leaves. The weeks following the August 2020 derecho were filled with great loss, but maybe most noticeably, the great loss of trees. In this moment, we were able to recognize more clearly the importance of our trees to our sense of community. The derecho provides a sobering reminder: greater risk of natural disaster means our trees are under a greater threat than ever. Recognizing that trees are both vital to our community identity and under threat, the Coe Tree Archive seeks to preserve this valuable component of our community identity. The Coe Tree Archive solidifies trees and our natural environment as an integral part of our college identify by recognizing the history of our trees as worthy of archiving alongside other aspects of the College’s history.\n\n\n\nRetired Coe logo circa 2001.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Environment is Mutable\nWe have a remarkable ability to transform our environment. While we increasingly see ways in which people have the capacity to destroy our environment and our climate, it is also important to appreciate humanity’s ability to contribute to nature. This makes for what may seem like a rare instance of optimism. As a community, we have tremendous agency over the urban forest on Coe’s campus. We should take comfort in opportunities we have to give back to our communities through nature.\n\n\n\nThis panoramic view of the academic quad circa the 1930s looks barren relative to the academic quad today. The trees we see here today are no accident of nature. Rather, the trees we see on our campus are the result of very intentional human effort from members of our community—a reminder of the power we have as individuals and members of our close communities to affect our environment for the better.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanting Trees Will Not Save the World—But It Can Benefit Someone\nAlthough we should not underestimate the power each of us has to change the world, we must also acknowledge that climate change, environmental injustice, and the degradation of the natural world are not issues any of us can can resolve individually. We cannot plant enough trees to compensate for systemic economic failures that incentivize greenhouse gas emissions.\nStill, trees provide tangible benefits to our local community. The project encourages all of us to find ways we can make piecemeal efforts to improve the quality of environments we inhabit. Whether its by volunteering with environmental groups, sharing our financial resources, speaking up for environmental causes, or of course, planting trees, the efforts we make today to improve our local environment benefit our community in meaningful ways. The Coe Tree Archive seeks to illustrate this point by celebrating not only our trees, but the staff, students, faculty, and alumni who have invested in the future of our campus by planting trees."

The original project inspiration goes to Coe professor Allison Carr. It was in Dr. Carr’s Environmental Rhetoric class where the project began as one way to find new ways to connect with nature in our everyday lives. As the project progressed, the opportunity to preserve the record of these trees became more tangible and the concept of the Coe Tree Archive came together. Similar efforts by others, like Dr. Marta Wells of Yale Nature Walk, helped to push the effort into its current form. Additionally, this project has benefited from the invaluable feedback of other students in the Fall 2022 Environmental Rhetoric class.\nStarting summer 2023, Evan will be joining the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as a Research Analyst in the Bank’s newly formed Climate Risk Studies department. You can contact Evan by emailing coe.tree.archive@gmail.com."

    "text": "There are many ways in which you can use your talents, your time, your financial resources, and your voice to support local trees. See the list below for some ideas on steps you can take to get connected to tree and environmental life around our community.\n\n\n\nIdentifying the trees in your community is not only a fun way to connect with the natural world in your everyday life, but an activity with the potential to meaningfully benefit your community. Paying close attention to the trees around can help catch damaging insect infestation early on—mitigating damages to tree life. It can also help identify threats that tree limbs might pose to people or buildings before these limbs fall in a storm. Lastly, identifying trees and helping others learn about the trees in their communities can inspire greater attitudes of sustainability in others. Connecting the people around you with the trees around both of you is a great way to build a passion for the natural world.\nIn its current state, the Coe Tree Archive only covers trees west of College Drive. A natural extension would be to cover Coe’s campus East of College Drive. You might also consider revisiting trees on the West side of campus, making sure that the trees are correctly identified and that the online list is comprehensive. If you find any errors, have any updates, or would like to expand the archive please reach out to the project maintainer, Evan Perry, at coe.tree.archive@gmail.com.\n\n\n\n\nIf you are interested in both connecting with the environment and connecting with other college students interested in the environment, then one of Coe’s environmental groups might be a great fit. Environmental Club, or E-Club as it is more commonly known, has a great history of tackling environmental causes and projects both around campus, and in our wider Cedar Rapids community. Check your Coe email to get connected with E-Club.\n\n\n\n\nAre you interested in planting trees or supporting local tree planting efforts? Consider supportingReLeaf Cedar Rapids. ReLeaf Cedar Rapids is a project partnership between the City of Cedar Rapids and the nonprofit group Tree’s Forever. The project’s website contains resources to help all individuals contribute to the effort to rebuild Cedar Rapids’ natural infrastructure following the derecho in Fall 2020.

These estimates all come from i-Tree Eco, a software product supported by the US Forest Service.\nFinally, the Tree Map displays the names, if available, of anyone who helped plant a tree. Many trees planted after the derecho have a metal tag that display the names of the members of the Coe community who helped plant the tree. The Tree Map contains these names as a way to celebrate those who helped rebuild our campus, and to help us all connect the environment around us to the hard work of our community."

    "text": "Oaks\nThe Oak tree is unambiguously the favorite tree of on campus. Acorns are the fruit of Oak trees and have long been a symbol of the College, in addition to being great food for our squirrels. Oak trees are by far the most common tree on campus, with 80 Oak trees on the campus west of College Drive. The Oak tree is also Iowa’s state tree.\nOak trees are easily identifiable by their acorns and leaves. Oak trees are the only trees that produce acorns. The leaves of oak trees can vary substantially, but are usually 5 to 10 inches long with 5 to 9 symmetrically arranged lobes.\nSpecies of Oak tree fall into one of two categories: Red Oaks or White Oaks. The difference has nothing to do with the color of the leaves, but actually the shape of the leaves. Red Oaks—including the Northern Red Oak, Black Oak, and Pin Oak—have pointed lobes. White Oaks—including the White Oak, Swamp White Oak, and Bur Oak—have rounded lobes.\n\n(Northern) Red Oaks\nQuercus rubra. There are 18 Northern Red Oaks on the campus west of College Drive. Like all Red Oak varieties, the leaves of Northern Red Oaks ends in a pointed tip, or a bristle tip. The easiest way to distinguish a Northern Red Oak from other Red Oak varieties with bristle tipped leaves is by the fullness of the leaf. While other Red Oak varieties have leaves with narrow lobes, the Northern Red Oak has very wide, filled-in lobes. The bark of Red Oaks is often smoother than similar Oak varieties as well.\n\n\nBlack Oaks\nQuercus velutina. The Black Oak is also common around campus, and very similar to the Northern Red Oak. The primary difference is that Black Oaks have leaves with 7 to 9 narrow somewhat narrow lobes. Many of the largest trees on campus are Black Oaks.\n\n\nPin Oaks\nQuercus palustris. Pin Oaks are less common around campus, but still a valued member of our urban forest. Even more than the leaves of Black Oaks, Pin Oaks have very narrow lobes. Pin Oaks also tend to have few lobes than most Oak varieties, as most leaves only have 5 to 7 lobes compared to other varieties with 7 to 9 lobes.\n\n\nWhite Oaks\nQuercus alba. There are 7 White Oaks on Coe’s campus west of College Drive, making them somewhat common. Most of the White Oaks we do have are fully matured and the largest trees on campus are often White Oaks. White Oaks have 7 to 9 lobes with rounded ends. These lobes can be somewhat narrow.\n\n\nSwamp White Oaks\nQuercus bicolor. Swamp White Oaks are the most common tree around Coe, with 27 Swamp White Oaks on Coe’s campus west of College Drive. Swamp White Oak leaves are distinctly bulbous compared to other Oak varieties, with lobes that are very wide and shallow compared to other Oak varieties. The bark of Swamp White Oaks often appears in long-strips, while many other Oaks have relatively smooth bark. In the fall, Swamp White Oaks retain their leaves longer than most trees. If you see a tree in late November with crisp light brown leaves still on the tree, there’s a good chance that its a Swamp White Oak.\n\n\nBur Oaks\nQuercus macrocarpa. Rounding out the set of Oak trees on campus, Bur Oaks make for an interesting variety of Oak. In contrast to Swamp White Oaks, Bur Oak leaves have almost overexaggerated lobes. Often the divot in the leaf (also called the sinus) just above the final lobe is large, creating a very narrow cross section just before the final lobe. The bark of young Bur Oak’s is especially shaggy in appearance."

    "text": "Maples\nBehind Oaks, Maples are the second most common deciduous tree on campus. Maple leaves are very recognizable, with 3 or 5 lobes extending to pointed tips. In general though, differentiating between different varieties of Maple is difficult, as many of the most popular cultivars are hybrids of different Maple varieties.\n\nSugar Maples\nAcer saccharum. Sugar Maples leaves have 5 lobes, with clear rounded out spaces between each lobe. Each lobe is very full and wide, an easy way to differentiate Sugar Maples from Silver Maples (which are common in many places, but not common on Coe’s campus). There are several sub-varieties of Sugar Maple on campus. The Autumn Fest Maple is a variety of a Sugar Maple, prized for its bright colors in the fall. Many of the Autumn Fest Maples on campus were planted in the aftermath of the 2020 derecho. Many of these are on located around Dows and around the academic quad.\n\n\nFreeman Maples\nAcer x freemanii. The Freeman Maple is a popular hybrid tree, a cross between a Red Maple and Silver Maple. Silver Maple leaves are identifiable by their slender lobes, a trait that appears in the Freeman Maple as well. The branches of Freeman Maples tend to be less “swoopy” than a standard Silver Maple, a trait from the Red Maple. Freeman Maples have a brilliant pink-orange color in the fall."

In the fall, the Elms on campus turn a bright yellow color. Oftentimes the edges of the Elm leaves brown first making it look like many of the Elm leaves on campus have spent some time in a toaster."

These leaves have no lobes at all, but have bundles of symmetrical leaflets. These trees turn a bright yellow in the fall. The bark of Honey Locust trees is also distinguishable, usually appearing as long strips of medium thickness, often with a slight mossy-green color. Honey Locust trees are often consider a nuisance tree because a standard Honey Locust has large thorns along its branches and dense patches of thorns on the trunk. All of the Honey Locust trees on Coe’s campus are Thornless Honey Locusts though, so you shouldn’t be afraid to hug any of the Honey Locust trees here."

    "text": "How Do We Estimate The Benefits of Trees?\nIn Fall 2022, all trees on the West side of of campus were identified, measured, and photographed. Importantly, the species of a tree and diameter at breast height (DBH) can say quite a bit about a tree. Trees of different species often grow in highly variable ways, such that even trees with identical trunk diameters are otherwise physically very different from each other. Similarly, trees of the same species but with different trunk diameters can also be highly different. But healthy trees of the same species and with the same trunk diameter are predictably similar. Scientists use this regularity to create statistical models that use the species and DBH to predict and physical characteristics of a tree (e.g., biomass). To estimate social benefits, these models incorporate local data on air pollution, precipitation, and the population.\nThis all sounds quite complicated, so thankfully there is software that will do all this work for us. The US Forest Service, in collaboration with a host of other public and private partners, created i-Tree Eco, a software that will estimate a host of benefits associated with an urban forest given the species and DBH of the trees. After providing the data on our trees at Coe, this software does all benefit calculations. i-Tree Eco is a free software available for installation on most devices."
