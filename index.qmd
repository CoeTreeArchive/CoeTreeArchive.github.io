## **Purpose**

The Coe Tree Archive serves as a tool to connect current and future members of the Coe community with the trees they encounter everyday. In doing so, this project attempts to reorient ourselves to the trees that surround us and view them as a valuable part of our community in their own right. Through the Coe Tree Archive, we hope that students recognize the power they have to improve the environment around them. For future members of the Coe community, we hope that this project offers a valuable glimpse into our tree life at this moment in history.

## **Guiding Principles**

### **Trees are a Part of Our College Identity**

Trees---particularly Oak trees---have long been an important part of the identity of Coe College. The College's yearbook, which ran from 1903 through 2007, was called *The Acorn*. Likewise, the College's sesquicentennial logo features an acorn and Oak leaves. The 2020 derecho reminded us of both the importance of our tree life on Coe's campus and the fragility of our tree life in the face of elevated climate risk. Recognizing that trees are both vital to our community identity and under threat, the Coe Tree Archive seeks to preserve records and stories of our trees. The Coe Tree Archive solidifies trees and our natural environment as an integral part of our Coe's identify by recognizing the history of our trees as worthy of archiving alongside other aspects of the College's history.

### **Our Environment is Mutable**

We have a remarkable ability to transform our environment. While we increasingly see ways in which people have the capacity to destroy our environment and our climate, it is also important to appreciate humanity's ability to contribute to nature. This creates what may seem like a rare instance of optimism. As a community, we have tremendous agency over the urban forest on Coe's campus. We should take comfort in opportunities we have to give back to our communities through nature.

Rather, the trees we see on our campus are the result of very intentional human effort from members of our community---a reminder of the power we have as individuals and members of our close communities to affect our environment for the better.](images/academic_quad.png)

### **Planting Trees Will Not Save the World---But It Can Benefit Someone**

Although we should not underestimate the power each of us has to change the world, we must also acknowledge that climate change, environmental injustice, and the degradation of the natural world are not issues any of us can can resolve individually. We cannot plant enough trees to save the world.

Still, trees provide tangible benefits to our local community. The project encourages all of us to find ways we can make piecemeal efforts to improve the quality of environments we inhabit. Whether its by volunteering with environmental groups, sharing our financial resources, speaking up for environmental causes, or of course, planting trees, the efforts we make today to improve our local environment benefit our community in meaningful ways. The Coe Tree Archive seeks to illustrate this point by celebrating not only our trees, but the staff, students, faculty, and alumni who have invested in the future of our campus by planting trees.

## **Project Background**

The Coe Tree Archive was created and is maintained by Evan Perry, a current senior studying Economics and Math at Coe.

Any success of the project is the result of the inspiration, guidance, and efforts of many others. The project originated in Dr. Allison Carr's Environmental Rhetoric class. Dr. Carr challenged students in her class to find creative ways they could connect with nature and environmentalism in everyday life. Although the original project focused on observing trees for purely the intrinsic benefit, the opportunity to preserve the record our trees in an accessible format became more apparent as it progressed and motivated the Coe Tree Archive. Similar efforts by others, like [Dr. Marta Wells](https://eeb.yale.edu/people/faculty-lecturer/marta-wells) of [Yale Nature Walk](https://naturewalk.yale.edu/about), helped to push the effort into its current form. This project has benefited from the invaluable feedback of other students in the Fall 2022 Environmental Rhetoric class.

Starting summer 2023, Evan will be joining the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as a Research Analyst in the Bank's newly formed Climate Risk Studies department. You can contact Evan by emailing [coe.tree.archive\@gmail.com](mailto:coe.tree.archive@gmail.com).
