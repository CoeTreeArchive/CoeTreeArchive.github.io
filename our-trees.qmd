The archive contains a dedicated tree profile for each of our trees on the west side of Coe's campus. These tree profiles contain more detailed information on individual trees than the tree map including the date recorded, i-Tree's estimated replacement value, images (if available), in addition to all the data available on the tree map. To find a specific tree, try searching by the Tree ID or the species of the tree.
