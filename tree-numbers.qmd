## **How Do We Estimate The Benefits of Trees?**

During the Fall 2022 semester, trees on the west side of of campus were identified, measured, and photographed. The primary records for each tree are its species and its [diameter at breast height (DBH)](https://www.portland.gov/trees/tree-care-and-resources/how-measure-tree), as these two fields are important determinants of other physical characteristics such as the tree's biomass.

After reviewing these data for accuracy, they were passed along to [i-Tree Eco](https://www.itreetools.org/about), a software for analyzing urban forests developed by the US Forest Service in collaboration with a host of other public and private partners. This software uses statistical models that have been calibrated on other trees from around the world to predict key features of the trees here at Coe. To estimate social benefits, these models incorporate local data on air pollution, precipitation, and the population. Those interested in the details of this process are encouraged to review the [documentation for i-Tree Eco](https://www.itreetools.org/support/resources-overview/i-tree-methods-and-files).

## **Access the Tree Data**

A central goal of the Coe College Tree Archive is to make engaging with Coe's natural environmental easier, both for current members of Coe's community and for future members of Coe's community. The tree data collected through this project offer a snapshot in time of the trees on our campus. To ensure anyone interested in our trees can easily explore this snapshot, data files from the project are available below in .csv, shapefile (easiest for mapping in R and Python), and .kml (easiest for mapping in Google Earth) formats.

Additionally, all raw data and the code needed to reproduce both the final dataset and the campus tree map are available for download on [the Coe College Tree Archive's GitHub repository linked here](https://github.com/CoeTreeArchive/CoeTreeArchive.github.io). This repository includes all images on the website. Data cleaning and visualization were done in the R programming language and the website itself was built using Quarto, a markdown language developed by Posit. All software used in the project are open source and available for free.
